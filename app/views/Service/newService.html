    Infrastructure as a Service
    </label>
    <p class="explanation">
        Infrastructure is the hardware that makes software work. Itâ€™s the networks, hosting facilities and servers that platforms and software depend on. IaaS is infrastructure you can order and run entirely over the internet, without having to pay for your own hardware.

        Software as a Service
    </label>
    <p class="explanation">
        SaaS is an application or service that can be run over the internet or in the cloud. For example, web-based email services, customer relationship management (CRM) software and analytics tools.

        Platform as a Service
    </label>
    <p class="explanation">
        Platforms are just that: software platforms that provide a basis for building other services and applications. With PaaS, you can set up, order, pay for and manage platforms in the cloud.
